Infant Cry Knowledge Graph

This repository contains the implementation of the Infant Cry Knowledge Graph (KG), the first unified graph framework designed to integrate heterogeneous infant cry datasets and their acoustic descriptors into a scalable Neo4j-based knowledge system.

The KG enables:
Cross-dataset semantic alignment of infant cry categories.
Feature-driven similarity linking using MFCC and prosodic descriptors.
Community detection and representation learning with Neo4j GDS.
An end-to-end supervised classification pipeline within Neo4j.
Balanced sampling strategies to mitigate dataset imbalance.
